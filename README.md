# Flexible-3GPP-Channel-Modeling-and-Calibration-with-Spatial-Consistency
## Introduction

The source code for the paper "Flexible 3GPP MIMO Channel Modeling and Calibration with Spatial Consistency" by Hongqing Huang, Kang Wang, etc., is listed here. 

In this paper, we proposed a two-layer perceptron network that allows the implementation of the sum-of-sinusoids model with an arbitrary spatial autocorrelation function, to generate spatially consistent random variables for system level channel simulation experiments. Then, we elaborated on a system-level simulation methodology, followed by the corresponding calibration results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide new performance benchmarks for the latest 5G New Radio channel models.
